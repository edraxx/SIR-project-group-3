PEPPER:  It's truly heartwarming to see the community rally for Katie Banks after such a devastating event. Reflecting on Katie's determination to keep her family together and continue her education 
is incredibly inspiring. How has her story affected you, and may I ask how many hours you'd be willing to volunteer to help us with the fundraiser by stuffing and addressing envelopes?
