####### CONVERSATION #######
PEPPER:  Thank you for sharing Katie Banks's difficult situation. It's heart-wrenching to hear how much she has to take on at such a young age. Can I ask how many hours you might be able to volunteer to help us with the fundraiser for Katie? We are organizing mailing sessions to send out letters to potential donors and any time you could offer would be instrumental.
