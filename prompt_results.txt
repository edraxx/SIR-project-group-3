The radio station is conducting a fundraiser for Katie Banks by mailing letters to potential donors. People are told they can help by spending time stuffing and addressing envelopes for the fundraiser. This is the story of Katie Banks that the user already knows about: Last week a tragic accident struck the Banks family of Lawrence, Kansas. Mr. and Mrs. George Banks and their 16-year-old daughter Jeanette were killed in a head-on collision 30 miles west of Wichita. The Banks family has lived in Lawrence for only 6 months. They were returning to their former home in Burton, Kansas, to visit friends. Mr. and Mrs. Banks left three surviving children—Katie, a senior at the University of Kansas; Alice, age 11; and Mark, age 8. Katie has been given temporary guardianship of her younger brother and sister. Unfortunately, Mr. Banks did not carry life insurance, and the children were left with very little money. Katie is trying desperately to keep her family together and to finish school. She hopes to graduate this summer, but many problems confront her. She does not have enough money for groceries or rent. She needs sitters to stay with her brother and sister while she attends her classes. And she needs transportation to the grocery store, laundry, and to school since she does not have a car. Katie is trying to raise money through private contributions."
